			<h3>What are keycaps?</h3>
			<p>Keycaps are what is put over switches and show what will be input into the computer when pressed. They go over the switch and can change how the keyboard looks and feels.</p>

			<h3>Keycap Profiles</h3>
			<img src="images/keycap-profiles.jpg" alt="keycap profiles">
			<p>The profile of a keycap is the shape of the keycap. It may be flat or rounded and if the individual rows have different profiles, it can result in the keyboard having an overall concave or sloped shape.</p>
		</article>

			<h3>ABS(Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) Keycaps</h3>
			<img src="images/abs.jpg" alt="abs keycaps">
			<p>These keycaps are the most commonly used plastic in keycaps. They are mass produced because of how cheap it is to make them and because how easy they are injection molded. They tend to feel smooth and develop a shine over time.</p>
		</article>
		
		<article>
			<h3>PBT(Polybutylene Terephthalate) Keycaps</h3>
			<img src="images/pbt.jpg" alt="pbt keycaps">
			<p>These keycaps are considered superior to ABS because they are not as cheaply made as ABS. They are more durable and wear down less over time. They are usually of a high quality and feel textured.</p>
